# Book Review Platform

A book review platform built with React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. This platform allows users to browse books, submit reviews, manage profiles, and (for admins) add new books. It features a Goodreads-inspired UI with Tailwind CSS styling, user authentication with JWT, and role-based access control.
